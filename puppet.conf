# The configuration file for agent.  Note that this file
# is likely to have unused configuration parameters in it; any parameter that's
# valid anywhere in Puppet can be in any config file, even if it's not used.
# 
# Every section can specify three special parameters: owner, group, and mode.
# These parameters affect the required permissions of any files specified after
# their specification.  Puppet will sometimes use these parameters to check its
# own configured state, so they can be used to make Puppet a bit more self-managing.
